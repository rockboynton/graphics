## lab1

Writing a C++ console program that:
* Accept a filename of an ASCII STL file via the command line
* Open and read file (recommend reading line-by-line using getline)
* Identify each facet, and print the coordinates of each of its vertices to the
  console, readable and formatted.
* Summarize contents
    * the number of facets in the file
    * the min and max of the x, y, and z coordinates
* No need to store vertices, etc â€“ we will do that later
